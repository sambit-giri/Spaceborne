All the available options and configurations can be found, along with their explanation, 
in the ``config.yaml`` file. Type hints for all of the different options are 
included in the comments. To run ``Spaceborne`` **using this configuration file**, 
activate the previously created ``spaceborne`` environment and simply run:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ python main.py

If you want to use a configuration file with a different name and/or path, you can 
do it with

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ python main.py --config=<path_to_config_file>

for example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python main.py --config="path/to/my/config/config.yaml"


To display the plots generated by the code, add the ``--show_plots`` flag:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python main.py --config="path/to/my/config/config.yaml" --show_plots

Keep in mind that quite a large amount of plots will be generated in this case.
